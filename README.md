### Hi there 👋

I'm Joe (or `JDTech` online), an electrical engineering student from Canada who codes for fun, convenience, and occasionally profit 😉. I use Python for *almost* everything—with the exception of occasional web projects and C++ for Arduino/ESP/VEX/FRC projects. Thanks for checking out my profile!

🔭 I’m currently working on ...

- _agile._, a startup working to enable real-time speech-to-speech translation in long-term care
- Artemis, a self-driving car targeting SAE Level 4 autonomy @ U of T's [aUToronto](https://www.autodrive.utoronto.ca/about-us) design team
- Plane n' Simple rev 0, a 2m wingspan remote control/semi-autonomous plane
- FINCH, a 3U cubesat @ U of T's [UTAT Space Systems](https://www.utat.ca/) design team
- A 3D printed robot dog, based on James Bruton's open-source [miniDog V2](https://github.com/XRobots/miniDogV2)
- Automated YouTube archiving Discord bot for the [Distributed YouTube Archive](https://j0e.ca/yt/) Discord server
- My homelab: Proxmox server, TrueNAS NAS, and 10G/40G network
- *...and all sorts of other small/random projects!*

📫 How to reach me:
- Fastest is Discord at `jdtech`
- Otherwise, email at `mail [ᴀᴛ] j0e [ᴅᴏᴛ] ca`
