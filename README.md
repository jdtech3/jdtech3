### Hi there 👋

I'm Joe (or `JDTech` online), an electrical engineering student from Canada who codes for fun, convenience, and occasionally profit 😉. I use Python for *almost* everything—with the exception of occasional web projects and C++ for Arduino/ESP/VEX/FRC projects. Thanks for checking out my profile!

🔭 I’m currently working on ...

- Automated YouTube archiving Discord bot for the [Distributed YouTube Archive](https://j0e.ca/yt/) Discord server
- A Mars rover @ U of T's [Robotics for Space Exploration](https://rsx.squarespace.com) design team
- FINCH, a 3U cubesat @ U of T's [UTAT Space Systems](https://www.utat.ca/) design team
- A 3D printed robot dog, based on James Bruton's open-source [miniDog V2](https://github.com/XRobots/miniDogV2)
- [PicoPowerMeter](https://github.com/jdtech3/PicoPowerMeter), a voltage/current/power/energy meter using the Raspberry Pi Pico, aiming to be ± 0.1% @ 0-24V and 0-1A
- My homelab: Proxmox server, TrueNAS NAS, and 10G/40G network
- *...and all sorts of other small/random projects!*
