### Hi there 👋

I'm Joe (or `JDTech` online), a student from Canada who codes for fun, convenience, and occasionally profit 😉. I use Python for *almost* everything—with the exception of occasional web projects and C++ for Arduino/ESP/VEX/FRC projects. Thanks for checking out my profile!

🔭 I’m currently working on ...

- Automated YouTube archiving Discord bot (for the [Distributed YouTube Archive](https://j0e.ca/yt/)) Discord server
- VEX EDR/AI robots for team [1010S](https://github.com/JRE-Robotics) and FRC robots for team 6364 at TenTon Robotics
- TheBrandTool: a branding and social media management tool 
- [Inova Computer Association](https://inovaca.org/): a non-profit organization aiming to spread computer science knowledge through webinars and interactive workshops
- *...and all sorts of other small/random projects!*

📫 How to reach me:
- Fastest is Discord at `JDTech#9954`
- Otherwise, email at `mail [ᴀᴛ] j0e [ᴅᴏᴛ] ca`
